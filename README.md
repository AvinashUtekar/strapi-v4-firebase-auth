#### Note
it is important to note that overriding the users-permissions plugin as shown in the example may cause issues if your Strapi version is different. This is because the example code is specifically tailored to version 4.7.1, and other versions of Strapi may have differences in the codebase.
If you encounter any issues, one possible solution is to compare the overridden files of the users-permissions plugin with the corresponding files in the node_modules directory of your Strapi installation. This can help identify any differences or incompatibilities that may be causing issues with the example code
